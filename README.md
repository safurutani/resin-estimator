# resin-estimator
While there are other websites that calculate how many items are needed for leveling up talents and characters in genshin - some even including the amount of resin needed - I wanted to create a tool that could factor in additional possibilities. Those being, the absolute maximum and minimum amounts of resin as well as the average between them since the drop rates for materials can vary. Also, if the player has xingqiu, there is a chance they get materials back upon crafting. This would give the player a better sense of how long/how much resing they would most likely be spending and not just give the quantity of items necessary.
