# Resin Estimator for Genshin Impact

This project is a tool for estimating the amount of resin needed to farm specific materials in the game Genshin Impact. There are two sections of calculations - one for talent leveling, one for character leveling. It takes the character as input to determine which materials you need. Then you can input the talent levels/character levels you're currently at and are aiming for. Additional parameters may be filled out (whether you have some of the materials already or have any bonuses) to give more precision. The site then calculates a minimum, average, and maximum value for the number of runs and overall resin needed to reach your goal.

# Example 
In this example we are leveling up one out of 3 possible talents to the max level with no books currently in our inventory, no xingqiu to help with crafting, and we plan on using condensed resin to make farming faster.

Similarly, in this example for character ascension, we want to get from level 40 to 80 and already have 2 of the materials needed:

# Note
This is a personal project so it is tailored to world level 8 drop rates. 
Character Leveling assumes you did not ascend at the current level and will not be ascending at the desired level if those inputs are exactly on ascension levels.
The traveler talent books vary so the number of each tier (green, blue, purple) of books is the same but they will not all be the same type.
